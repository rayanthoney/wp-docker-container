## Services

### WordPress
The WordPress service provides a robust content management system (CMS) for building dynamic websites and blogs. With Docker, managing WordPress becomes hassle-free, ensuring a consistent development environment across different platforms.

### MySQL
MySQL serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing WordPress data. Our Dockerized MySQL setup includes features like secrets management for secure password handling and data volume management for persistence.

### phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin offers a user-friendly web interface for managing MySQL databases. With our Docker Compose setup, you can easily access and interact with your MySQL databases through phpMyAdmin, streamlining database management tasks.

## <a name="installation">üöÄ Installation</a>

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

## <a name="usage">üì¶ Usage</a>

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker-compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the`down` command:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

### phpMyAdmin

Access your WordPress site at `http://localhost:8000` and phpMyAdmin at `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

The default username is `root`, and the password is the same as supplied in the `.env` file.
